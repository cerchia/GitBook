# DRT Direct Impact Lending (DIL)

Loans for projects to finance climate resilience or mitigation initiatives. Loans are linked to a parametric trigger which offsets the loan in case of a catastrophic event. Guarantees can be added to enhance credit rating. Once triggered, the loan forfeits, which removes event risk for project finance.

Compared to Direct Risk Transfer (DRT) in Direct Impact Lending

* There is a 3rd participant, the Guarantor (G), who guarantees the payback at maturity to the Seller (S) in case no event happens during the dealâ€™s term
* The Buyer (B) receives a reduced notional to finance investments once a deal is matched and a G has committed funds
* Need whitelisting for B and known identity for recovery process (private subnet?)
