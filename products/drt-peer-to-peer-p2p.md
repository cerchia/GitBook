# DRT Peer to Peer (P2P)

DRT offers an efficient and scalable mechanism to transfer risk between investors and protection buyers. Risk positions linked to parametric triggers can be managed and traded via DRT as a standardized ILW reinsurance or financial product. For example, you can trade industry loss caps for events like named hurricanes, live and post-event, on an open marketplace.
