# What is Direct Risk Transfer

Risk transfer is a common risk management technique where an entity's potential loss from an adverse outcome is shifted to a third party. The third-party receives a premium to compensate the third party for bearing the risk. The most common example of risk transfer is insurance. Insurance companies transfer tail risk to reinsurance companies, which can transfer to other reinsurers (retrocession) or to the capital markets (ILS, e.g. CatBond).

Direct Risk Transfer simplifies the traditional Risk Transfer process with a standardized contract to transfer risk peer-to-peer. Direct Risk Transfer directly (with no intermediaries) connects those seeking protection from event risks (Protection Buyer) and those who provide protection (Protection Seller) in a decentralized way. Buyers buy protection by offering a Premium, and Sellers sell protection to generate a yield. The size (amount) of the protection is called the Notional. Protection is against events based on an [Index](risk-types-index-and-trigger.md) (e.g., an earthquake in a certain region) and further defined on standardized terms (e.g., the level of the earthquake and the protection term). Users can choose from a set of predefined event risks and standardized terms. DRT [contracts](../legal/master-agreement-+-termsheet.md) are not insurance but financial products and, thus, do not require any counterparty to be an insurer.

The blockchain is used as a bulletin board where Buyers and Sellers can place their offers or match an existing offer bilaterally.

Conceptually, DRT requires a protection buyer to deposit a premium in secure [escrow](automated-escrow.md) and a protection seller to accept such an offer (“bid”) by depositing the protection amount reduced by said premium in the same escrow. Vice versa, a protection seller can offer to sell protection by depositing a protection amount reduced by the requested premium in escrow (“ask”). A protection buyer can accept this offer by depositing the required premium in escrow. All cash flows are settled in a limited range of collateralized stablecoins (no crypto or DRSK Tokens).

As a bilaterally agreed financial derivative, the buyer and the seller ensure their eligibility and compliance to transact such contract under local laws and, where applicable, cross borders.
