# Prerequisites

**Connect with a wallet.** We advise on commonly used browser wallets, depending on the blockchain you plan to use: for Avalanche, we suggest using the **MetaMask** wallet (browser extension); for Zilliqa, the extension **ZillPay**. Also, make sure you are using a Wallet Address with which you successfully have performed the third-party [KYX-check](../legal/kyx-aml.md).

You also **need native protocol currency** to pay the gas fees of the blockchain to interact with the marketplace that links to smart contracts on the blockchain (AVAX on Avalanche; ZIL on Zilliqa).\
\
Furthermore, **you need sufficient stablecoins** (i.e., the digital image on the blockchain of a fiat currency) that will be used as premium and settlement currency. To engage in a deal, ensure to have a sufficiently large balance ready of one of the following stablecoins: on Avalanche USDC (regulated and the fully collateralized equivalent of USD); on Zilliqa, either zUSDT (USDT bridged from Ethereum and wrapped as USD equivalent) or XSGD (a fully regulated and collateralized SGD equivalent).

Thus, ensure you hold the needed stablecoins and some AVAX or ZIL in your wallet**.**&#x20;
