How it works:

1. Backed receives USD from client (after successful onboarding with Backed Finance AG)
2. Backed buys ETF and deposits it in a segregated SPV collateral account with custodian InCore/ Maerki Baumann bank
3. Segregated means one collateral account per product, not per client
4. The holdings get tokenized and sent to the client
5. Tokens are tracker certificates, essentially a debt instrument. Price is pegged to and backed 1/1 by the underlying
6. The Token does not convey any rights over the underlying itself. its just a tracker.
7. Backed is built in a bankruptcy remote way. The underlyings are pledged to the token holders.
