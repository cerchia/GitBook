# Risk Types (Index) and Trigger

In the context of risk transfer, various types of risk can be transferred. Event risk refers to the risk of a specific event, such as a natural disaster, pandemic spread or other catastrophic events that can cause significant financial losses. Direct Risk Transfer allows all risks to be transferred as long they qualify for a parametric trigger.

A parametric trigger is a predetermined condition/ threshold that triggers the payment of a pre-agreed sum of money to the beneficiary of a risk transfer arrangement. This trigger type is typically used for insurance or reinsurance contracts designed to protect against specific event risks. For example, the magnitude of an earthquake, the speed of a hurricane and also the number of people infected by a virus or river levels.

For example, in the case of an insurance contract designed to protect against hurricane damage, a parametric trigger might be set based on the hurricane's wind speed. If the wind speed exceeds a pre-agreed threshold, the policy will be triggered, and the insurer will pay the policyholder a pre-agreed sum of money.

Parametric triggers are particularly useful for event risks because they allow for a quick and objective assessment of whether the trigger conditions have been met, which can help to speed up the claims process and ensure that payments are made quickly and efficiently. Additionally, parametric triggers can help reduce disputes or disagreements over whether a loss has occurred since the trigger conditions are predetermined and objective.

As an alternative to pure parametric. also loss indexes can be used as an index. Here trusted third-party data providers provide data of industry loss for a given catastrope.
