# Risk Standards and Data

The generic DRT Smart Contracts are parametrised with a fixed set of Standards, allowing the transfer of risk in a standardised manner, eliminating paper, physical contracts and confirmations altogether. The Standards are stylised as follows:

Each Standards risk is categorised (geophysical, biological, hydrological, etc.) and linked to a suitable data source, used as the parametric trigger index for the DRT Smart Contracts. International and open data licences are typically prerequisites for a suitable data source. The Standards are trademarked, with the intellectual property owned and managed by the DRSK Association.
