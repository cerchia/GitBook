# Decentralized Marketplace

A decentralized marketplace for DRT enables buyers to find sellers and vice versa and directly enter DRT Smart Contracts without intermediaries. DDM is not a trading venue nor an exchange, as no matching or intermediation is performed.&#x20;

Like a bulletin board, the DDM allows displaying of DRT Smart Contract activity such as bids, asks, and live and terminated contracts on the specific public DLT. Individual buyers and sellers of protection can publish their offers to buy (“bid”) or sell (“ask”) at a committed premium amount directly to DLT (not DDM). DDM helps display such new DRT Smart Contract activity on DLT, and interested users can enter DRT by accepting a bid or an ask directly on DLT.

If not accepted by another party, bids and asks can be cancelled by the initiating party at any time (on DLT).
