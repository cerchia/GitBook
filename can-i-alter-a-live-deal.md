# Can I alter a live deal?

No, since the funds are locked in a smart contract, only expiry or the trigger event can terminate an active deal. Also, changes in the active deal are not possible. To offset exposure, you can place a new deal on the DDM with the inverse conditions. E.g. you buy protection against an event you have exposure to as a protection seller. If the event triggers, you end up paying the notional but receiving it simultaneously, given you find a counterparty matching your cover deal.
