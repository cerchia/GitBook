# How to buy protection

As a protection buyer, you must ensure you fulfil the [prerequisites](../how-does-risk-transfer-work/prerequisites.md) to access the marketplace. Also, you must have completed the [onboarding](../legal/kyb-aml.md). Note that currently, only professional investors can participate in the marketplace.

When buying protection, opt for the marketplace and choose a market which reflects your preferences.

The markets are composed of indices, sorted into main categories (e.g. geophysical), event type (e.g. earthquake), and region (e.g. Indonesia).

Once an index is selected, you can parameterize the desired protection you want to buy or sell.

Select the **reference currency** you want to trade on the top right (e.g. USDC). Then define the Strike level (e.g. eight on Shindo Scale) and the maturity (e.g. 31.03. - 31.12.). All the set parameters point to a unique Symbol.

Once selected, you can scan the marker for open Asks or Bids.&#x20;

In case nothing shows up, there are no open orders on the board, and you either change the parameters or place an open order, Ask or Bid yourself if you are curious to see all open orders for an Index, head back to the Marketplace tab and hit the browse button.
