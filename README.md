# Onboarding

## 1. Install a ERC-20/ERC-1155 compliant wallet like Metamask

If you haven't done so, please install a wallet like Metamask. We will offer integrations with other providers soon.

For Metamask, follow this [link](https://metamask.io/download/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you save your private key and backup phrase!

For details, make sure you follow these [instructions](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015290032-How-to-reveal-your-Secret-Recovery-Phrase).
{% endhint %}

## 2. Create/Use a Quadrata passport

You can only trade on DRTâ„¢ if you have a Quadrata passport. For this, you have to provide relevant documents of your business, which are then verified through Quadrata's verification partner.&#x20;

During this process, you can enter one or more wallet addresses to which Quadrata will issue a passport, an NFT token, authenticating you and your business.

You can use this without a verification process if you have already been issued a Quadrata passport, which means you previously used a different distributed Application.

For more info about Quadrata, please visit their [website](https://quadrata.com/).

## 3. Fund your wallet with USDC

Our marketplace uses USDC as the trading currency, others will be added later, but for you to trade, you need to fund your wallet with USDC, as this is something you can do via different means. We will not go into details here.

## 4. Happy trading
