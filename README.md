# Introduction

### Welcome to DRT**™ -** We connect the capital market with protection seekers such as reinsurance companies, multinational organizations, and enterprises, to create a resilient world by reducing the protection gap by making risk transfer affordable and accessible.

## About us

We are Cerchia, a Swiss fintech company, establishing access to a USD 2’000bn market opportunity. Founded in 2020 and headquartered in Switzerland, with a representative office in Singapore, Cerchia allows for automated parametric event risk payouts/returns. Indices provided by certified agencies trigger payouts.

It enables direct transfer of event risk between protection buyers and sellers by utilizing smart contracts, allowing demand/supply-driven pricing through a decentralized market pricing mechanism. It offers the most cost-efficient, scalable, transparent, and secure solution.

### Reimagine a resilient world

Year after year, we experience more and more severe natural catastrophes due to climate change. The frequencies and the intensity of the events continue to rise. At the same time, the protection gap, which describes the total losses minus insured losses, continues to widen. Imagine a world where uninsured businesses and emerging countries have access to a novel type of protection. Managing risk peer-to-peer, without intermediaries and at lower costs. That’s what **DRT™** is all about. Providing access to direct risk transfer.
