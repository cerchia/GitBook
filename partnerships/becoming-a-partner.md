We aim to reduce the global Protection Gap to create a resilient world. As a technology platform, we seek ecosystem partners to help build and expand the decentralized platform. Visit our [website](https://www.cerchia.io) and reach out to us to further discuss.

Strategic partnerships could be in the areas of:

* Data providers/ Calculation Agents (e.g. New data models, AI, Reinsurance)
* Insurance and Reinsurance companies
* Capacity providers, e.g. hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds
* Liquidity providers and market makers
* NGOs and Development Banks
