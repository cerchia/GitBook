# Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a device or program that stores your cryptocurrency keys and allows you to access your digital assets. Wallets contain a public key (the wallet address) and your private keys needed to sign cryptocurrency transactions.

In order to interact with the marketplace you need a supported wallet which is able to interact with the underlying blockchain.

Currently we support below wallets to interact with DRT. We are continuously adding wallets and will be supporting [FireBlocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/) as well as [Safe](https://safe.global/) soon.
