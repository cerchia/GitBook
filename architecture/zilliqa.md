# Zilliqa

[Zilliqa](https://www.zilliqa.com/) is a smart contract platform featuring a sharded architecture that aims to address the scalability limitations seen in some other blockchains. Its sharded design allows concurrent chains to execute transactions in parallel, thereby increasing the network's overall capacity.

Zilliqa was launched in June 2017 by co-founders Amrit Kumar and Xinshu Don, two researchers from the National University of Singapore. The network’s mainnet went live in January 2019.&#x20;

The project held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the ZIL token in 2017, at the time raising over $22 million in ETH.&#x20;

Zilliqa is supported by the founding Zilliqa Research company as well as a growth initiative company, ZILHive.



### How Does Zilliqa Work?

***

The Zilliqa network offers many features common to other cryptocurrency networks such as smart contracting, transaction settlement, and token issuance.

Developers can use its proprietary language, Scilla, to run custom programming logic (smart contracts) and design new programs (decentralized applications) to offer a variety of products and services.

While this system is complex in implementation, Zilliqa is ultimately designed to execute smart contracts and confirm network transactions in a scalable and efficient manner.

#### Sharding

Sharding is a structural technique that splits the network into several pieces, or shards, allowing nodes to only process a fraction of the network’s transactions.

Each shard acts as its own blockchain and allows nodes assigned to them to store data, process transactions and add new blocks to their specific shard chain, called microblocks.&#x20;

Microblocks are then combined into a transaction block by Directory Service Nodes (or DS nodes) to be added to the Zilliqa blockchain.

Of note, the shard nodes contain a specific subset of the Zilliqa blockchain, and do not have to store Zilliqa’s entire history.

#### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)

Central to Zilliqa is the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) governance mechanism that keeps the distributed network of computers in sync.

In order for nodes to power the blockchain and vote on changes, they must first stake ZIL, meaning that anyone who owns ZIL can help operate the network. Using pBFT, all nodes assigned to specific shards must agree before a microblock is finalized and combined into a transaction block.&#x20;

Each node is subsequently rewarded with a portion of the block reward for validating the transactions.
