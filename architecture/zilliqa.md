# Zilliqa

[Zilliqa](https://www.zilliqa.com/) is a smart contract platform featuring a sharded architecture that aims to address the scalability limitations seen in some other blockchains. Its sharded design allows concurrent chains to execute transactions in parallel, thereby increasing the network's overall capacity.
