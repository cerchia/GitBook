# Master Agreement + Termsheet

From a legal perspective, buyer and seller authorising a transaction correspond to entering a bilateral ISDA master agreement and signing a term sheet reflecting the risk being transferred.&#x20;

A DRT is based on a bilateral financial derivative contract, but based on a simplified form of the ISDA template, which becomes legally binding when the parties authorise the deposits in their digital accounts. All contract components (contracting parties, price, hedging amount, term, hedged risk, data source, settlement method) are regulated and programmed directly in the associated smart contract. At the electronic request of the parties (unilateral), the underlying financial derivatives contract can be retrieved from the smart contract and printed out as a pdf.

A term sheet is a document that describes the terms of a deal and provides information about the counterparties. There are two stages for it, Predeal and Postdeal. Both term sheets refer to data stored on the blockchain (standard, notional, etc.), its wallet addresses, and the resolution of the wallet addresses to actual KYB data.
