# Master Agreement + Termsheet

From a legal perspective, buyer and seller authorising a transaction correspond to entering a bilateral ISDA master agreement and signing a term sheet reflecting the risk being transferred.&#x20;

A term sheet is a document that describes the terms of a deal and provides information about the counterparties. There are two stages for it, Predeal and Postdeal. Both term sheets refer to data stored on the blockchain (standard, notional, etc.), its wallet addresses, and the resolution of the wallet addresses to actual KYB data.
