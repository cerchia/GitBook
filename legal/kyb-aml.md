# KYB/ AML

Regulatory Compliance is factored into the design of Direct Risk Transfer (DRT) for a sustainable business model and at the core of our operations.

To enter into a DRT contract, the platform validates whether your wallet address with which you are connected to the platform was successfully validated and whitelisted. To get whitelisted, you must pass a verification which a trusted third-party provider is performing. The provider will perform the following tasks:

* If the user has a passport.&#x20;
* If the user owns more than one wallet.&#x20;
* The user's AML risk score.
* From which country the passport was issued.
* The wallet's on-chain reputation
* The wallet's VantageScore (soon)
* If the user is an accredited investor (soon)
* If the user is above an age range (soon)

We wonâ€™t store any CID (Client Identifying Data); only the wallet address is used as nonspecific data, such as the counterparty's license type. After Personal data is processed and mapped, fill out the term sheet, which is not stored on central servers, but decentrally (IPFS). In line with GDPR regulations, any temporary storage must and will be purged every 48 hours of documents older than that.
