# Setting the Strike

The strike or in insurance terms "attachment point" is the threshold above which the coverage gets paid out to compensate the protection buyer, e.g. to ensure business continuity or compensate for losses. The strike differs for each [Index](../how-does-risk-transfer-work/risk-types-index-and-trigger.md). For example parameters can be linked to level scales or to a loss index, where a dollar amount of  expected losses for an event are aggregated.

Selecting the correct strike or attachment point in parametric insurance has an implication on the event probability and the premium, as well as whether the ask will be matched.

Here are some steps to guide you in making this determination:

1. **Understand the Risk:**
   * Begin by thoroughly understanding the nature of the risk being transferred. Consider the specific perils, events, or conditions that the parametric insurance is designed to cover. This understanding lays the foundation for determining an appropriate attachment point.
2. **Review Historical Data:**
   * Analyze historical data related to the risk. Examine past occurrences of the events you are trying to cover and identify the thresholds at which significant impacts occurred. This can provide insights into appropriate attachment points.
3. **Engage with Experts:**
   * Consult with experts in relevant fields, such as meteorologists, seismologists, or other specialists depending on the nature of the risk. Their expertise can help validate your understanding and guide the selection of an attachment point.
4. **Consider Sensitivity and Tolerance:**
   * Assess the financial and operational impact of different attachment points. Balance this against the risk tolerance of both parties.
5. **Modeling and Simulation:**
   * Utilize modeling and simulation tools to test different attachment point scenarios. Run simulations based on various attachment points to assess the impact on payouts and understand how different levels might align with the actual risk.
6. **Customization for Location and Specifics:**
   * Tailor attachment points to the specific characteristics of the location or entity. Different regions may have varying susceptibilities to certain events, and customization enhances the relevance of the attachment point.
