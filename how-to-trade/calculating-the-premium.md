The marketplace ongoingly integrates data sources with historical data, risk parameters and models to help market participates defining the right premium.

Please consult our partnering firms or an independent risk modeler, specialized in parametric insurance to support you.

Find in the following further details on the subject and some steps to consider while calculating a suitable premium.

As a rule of thumb, the premium should always compensate for the risk taken, which means the probability of the trigger event.

**Traditional Reinsurance**

Premium calculation in reinsurance involves various steps and roles, often with the involvement of risk modelers and calculation agents. Here's an explanation:

1. **Risk Modeling:**
   * **Role of Risk Modelers:** Risk modelers analyze historical data, market trends, and other relevant factors to build models that estimate the likelihood and severity of potential losses. These models help insurers and reinsurers understand the risks associated with a particular policy.
2. **Calculation Agent:**
   * **Role of Calculation Agent:** The calculation agent is responsible for determining the final premium based on the risk model, policy terms, and market conditions. This role may be performed by the reinsurer, a third-party entity, or even the ceding insurer. The calculation agent ensures that the premium aligns with the assessed risk.
3. **Factors in Premium Calculation:**
   * **Rate on Line (ROL):** The ROL is a crucial factor, representing the percentage of the total coverage amount that the premium covers. It's a key component in determining the overall cost of reinsurance.
   * **Expected Loss:** This is the anticipated amount the reinsurer expects to pay out in claims. It is a vital factor in premium calculation and is based on the risk model's predictions.
   * **Attachment Point and Excess of Loss:** These terms define the levels at which the reinsurance coverage becomes effective. The attachment point is the threshold at which the reinsurer starts covering losses, and excess of loss is the amount of loss above this threshold that the reinsurer will cover.

**Parametric insurance:**

* **Difference from Traditional Reinsurance:** Parametric reinsurance differs by linking payouts to specific, predefined triggers rather than actual incurred losses. Hence, parametric insurance is detached to indemnity and can be set in line with a pre-defined scenario where no property must be directly insured. The triggers are often quantitative measurements such as earthquake magnitude, wind speed, or rainfall amount.
* **Setting Triggers in Parametric Insurance:** Trigger levels in parametric insurance must be carefully set to align with the occurrence of an event that is likely to result in a financial loss. This involves considering historical data, scientific models, and expert opinions to determine thresholds that accurately represent the occurrence of the insured event.

Defining the trigger level for parametric insurance involves a thoughtful and data-driven approach. Here are steps and considerations to help define an appropriate trigger level:

1. **Understand the Risk:**
   * Begin by thoroughly understanding the risk being insured. This includes studying historical data, scientific models, and any other relevant information pertaining to the specific peril or event.
2. **Consult Experts:**
   * Engage with experts in the field related to the insured risk. This could involve meteorologists, seismologists, or other specialists who can provide insights into the characteristics and thresholds of the events you are trying to cover.
3. **Review Historical Data:**
   * Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends related to the insured event. Look for historical trigger levels that would have appropriately indicated the occurrence of a significant event.
4. **Consider External Data Sources:**
   * Utilize external data sources, such as government agencies, research institutions, or industry databases, to supplement your understanding of the risk. This can provide additional validation for trigger level decisions.
5. **Modeling and Simulation:**
   * Use modeling and simulation techniques to test different trigger scenarios. This involves running simulations based on various trigger levels to assess the impact on payouts and the overall effectiveness of the parametric insurance.
6. **Customization for Specifics:**
   * Tailor trigger levels to the specific characteristics of the insured entity or location. For example, a parametric insurance policy for earthquake risk may have different trigger levels for regions with varying susceptibility to seismic activity.
7. **Periodic Review:**
   * Regularly review and update trigger levels based on new data, scientific advancements, or changes in the risk landscape. Parametric insurance is adaptive, and trigger levels may need adjustment over time.

Determining a fair trigger level involves a balanced consideration of scientific, historical, and stakeholder input. It's a dynamic process that should be revisited periodically to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness in managing the insured risk.
