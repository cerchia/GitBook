# Understanding the Parameters

You can place a deal or match an open order once all parameters are defined.

Parameters include:

* Risk
* Country
* Region
* Strike
* Term

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the selected currency and the blockchain are essential parameters as well. If the currency or blockchain deviates from a potential counterparty you won't see its open order or vice versa.
{% endhint %}

Once all parameters are selected, the system assigns a "symbol" which is the reference to a marketplace. You can trade with counterparties which are eager to trade with the exact same parameters.

An important parameter is the strike level. In below example you see industry loss in USD for a peril. The amount refers to the loss insurance companies expect caused by a peril. Stikes can have any value which can be binary determined - where a true or false condition can be met.

Terms are mainly set in 3-months units. This supports the mission to standartise Risk Transfer.
