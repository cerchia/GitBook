# DRSK Association and Governance

A supranational and self-regulating association (DRSK) is advancing the cause for decentralized peer-to-peer risk transfer and is a vital success factor on a global scale. It promotes best practices and standards for decentralized peer-to-peer risk transfer to its members. DRSK is going further by providing participants with Direct Risk Transfer (DRT), a self-governed implementation of best practices and standards to process and settle decentralized peer-to-peer risk transfer. The DRSK governing body is an Association (Decentral Autonomous Association) planned to be set up in Switzerland. Additional voting rights can be obtained in the association depending on the interaction with the marketplace and the holding of DRSK tokens.

For empowering and equipping participants worldwide with simple access to DRT, DRSK provides a free template to establish a DRT Decentralized Marketplace (DDM).
