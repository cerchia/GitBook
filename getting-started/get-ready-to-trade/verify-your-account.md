You can only trade on DRTâ„¢ if you have a valid passport. For this, you have to provide relevant documents of your business, which are then verified through our business verification partner, Quadrata.

Follow the step by step guide from the provider, directly on the DRT marketplace page.&#x20;

During the process, you can add one or multiple wallet addresses to which Quadrata will connect the passport to. Make sure to use the wallet address(es) with which you intend to use DRT.&#x20;

Once finished, you can submit the verification and you will be contacted by Quadrata thereafter.

Once you are successfully onboarded, you can visit your Quadrata account and mint your passport. Make sure you also connect with the Avalanche blockchain.

You can use this without a verification process if you have already been issued a Quadrata passport, which means you previously used a different distributed Application.
