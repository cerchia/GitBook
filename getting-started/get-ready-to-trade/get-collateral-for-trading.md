# Get Collateral for Trading

## Get Collateral

Our marketplace requires a stable collateral as the trading currency.

</div>

Currently we support:

* USDC - digital USD issued by [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)
* USDT - digital USD issued by [Tether](https://tether.to/)
* BIB01 - digital USD Treasury Bills issued by [Backed](https://backed.fi/)

For trading without digital collateral, we offer an alternative.

* CUSDC - collateral held in traditional escrow, please contact us for more details.

We recommend using BIB01 since this is the only option generating risk-free interest on your collateral.



{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you can only trade against open deals in the same currency.
{% endhint %}

### Funding your wallet with BIB01

In order to aquire BIB01 you must:

* Onboard with Backed - [here](https://www.backedassets.fi/create-an-account)
* Or buy BIB01

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to buy BIB01 on the Avalanche Blockchain
{% endhint %}

### Fund your wallet with AVAX

We will eliminate this requirement, but until then, you need to fund your wallet with AVAX to pay the gas fees necessary for the transaction. Initially, AVAX equivalent to 10 USD should suffice for some transactions.

Find here the ways to [acquire AVAX](https://milkroad.com/buy/avax/)
